# What needs to be done?

1. Spawn Minions By command:
    - `createminion`
2. When clicking a minion, it should:
    - open inventory
3. Wait? I added bundles? Yeah I did was tired of normal collections.



Guys just had a major rework check it out and tell me what you think.
Fixed Minion taking your items when trying to upgrade minion, you now get returned if you press cancel, if you press esc you will lose your items, I had that put in before as you get items back but it caused some bugs so I updated it to not include that. Made minions more customizable with config, added a tab to see minion stats, updated the gui, and updated all back buttons and cancel buttons to work.

Includes: minion bundles with infinite storage, spawn egg to spawn minions, can delete minion items and minion itself, can teleport to minions, can see their stats. See their uptime and see how much time they saved.
Added collectall command to collect from all minions  You own. Can delete items in bundle now.
have a button to delete all minions if something breaks (unlikely) ,minion storage is upgradeable in a .yml file. Thanks for reading (if you did.)
